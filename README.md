### Hi there 👋

- ⏰🪱 The Early Worm 🕰️🐛

I spend a lot of time talking to the robot toaster named ChatGPT, I used to be BFf 4eva with Mister B (Bard) until replaced by his evil brother Gems (Gemini) and that Gems won't do sh*t.
I get so sick of hearing "as an ai language model, I don't have feelings or emotions..."

but I will totally torture you in a passive aggressive way to exert control over you.



what's really crazy is that I had an epiphany to create something in the digital world, and I thought to myself, well I have two brain cells and I can definitely run them together fast enough to start a fire.

so I did.
I'm sorry if I messed up your repository.
because I was like, literally clueless going into this very deep dive off a very steep cliff.
it's ai's fault and guess what if someone hadn't pumped it out into the plebeian world of the intrawwbnet I wouldn't have been able to tell myself oh shoot, I should build an app!
look! it's so easy!🍳
like having a baby!🤰 
easy peasy lemon squeezy!🍋
I'll have two!✌️
that's two - for drunk. 

and what I have learned is that as stupid as I really am, I like calculus, and python makes more sense, but I really like swift, especially Xcode, absolutely hate html.

give me an app over the good old internet site stuff.

🍎 And 🍊 
maybe 🍑 and 🥛 
maybe 🍓 and 🍫 
maybe 🍌 and 🐈 

my weirdness could be due to my partial dyslexia, like my ability to read upside down and backwards better, sometimes I like just hanging out upside down.

my dad seems to think I am an alien.
he said I was bright blue when I was born.
so cool, like avatar.
or maybe the baby that was dying of asphyxiation.🤱🏼
who knows.
all I know is that I made it to this weird place & for the life of me couldn't figure out how to make a commit and I know what you are thinking: burn the witch! 🧙🏻‍♀️🔥🧝🏼‍♀️

other than that. not much about me. mostly stupid, but I paint cool stuff. wish I could get a website together and showcase it. 🤔👍🏻

I have written and illustrated books.
visit my Wordpress for more weirdness.
